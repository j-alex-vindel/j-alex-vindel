## About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @j-alex-vindel a PhD student at Strathclyde University in the Business School 
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical optimization, linear programming, integer programming, network optimization and bi-level programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use gurobi solver in python environment, stochastic modelling, and convex optimization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on integer programming and operations research as a whole
- 📫 How to reach me, by email at (jose.vindel-garduno@strath.ac.uk) / (alexander.vindel@gmail.com)

## Here is a summary of Repos:
- ME_MIBLP -> Mixed integer Linear modeling with Gurobi in metabolic engineering
- ME_GA -> Genetic Algorithm for multi objective modeling with Gurobi in metabolic engineering
- BAFA2019 -> Data Analysis (pandas) and dashboard (streamlit) for season 2019 
- Data_BAFA Scrapers -> Web crawlers and scrapers to collect data for BAFA 2019 (beautifulsoup, selenium)
- Games Dev -> Text Adventure game in python and a 'dodging' game using pygame
